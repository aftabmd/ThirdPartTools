# SSCatalog

SSCatalog is an example application to demonstrate various features of [SSToolkit](https://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit).

To get the source code, run the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/samsoffes/sscatalog.git --recursive

If you are seeing errors that SSToolkit isn't found, you probably forgot the `--recursive` flag. You can initialize the submodules manually by running the following in the SSCatalog directory:

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

If you have trouble getting SSCatalog running, please open an issue.
